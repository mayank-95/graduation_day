# University Attendance README

This README file provides an overview of the problem statement and instructions for solving it.

## Problem Statement

In a university, your attendance determines whether you will be allowed to attend your graduation ceremony. You are not allowed to miss classes for four or more consecutive days. Your graduation ceremony is on the last day of the academic year, which is the Nth day.

Your task is to determine the following:

1. The number of ways to attend classes over N days.
2. The probability that you will miss your graduation ceremony.

### String Format for the Solution

The solution should be represented in the string format as "Answer of (2) / Answer of (1)", where:
- "Answer of (1)" is the number of ways to attend classes over N days.
- "Answer of (2)" is the probability that you will miss your graduation ceremony.

## How to Use

python main.py

## Test Cases

Here are some test cases along with their expected results:

- For 5 days: "Answer of (2) / Answer of (1)" = "14/29"
- For 10 days: "Answer of (2) / Answer of (1)" = "372/773"

You can use these test cases to verify the correctness of the solution.

## Implementation

You can find the implementation of the solution in the code files provided with this repository.
